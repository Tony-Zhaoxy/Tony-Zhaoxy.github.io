<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Xiaoyang (Tony) Zhao is an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at UCLA, where he is a member of the Structures–Computer Interaction (SCI) Lab, working on agricultural robotics, UAV systems, and machine learning. He received his B.Eng. (Honours) in Aerospace Engineering from The University of Manchester, where he worked on UAV design, EV battery thermal management, and structural analysis.

His experience spans UAV aerodynamics, ANSYS Fluent simulations, FEA-based structural analysis, and robotic system design, with hands-on involvement in competitions such as the BMFA Payload Challenge and the IMechE UAS Challenge. He previously interned as a Mechanical Engineer at SLB Qingpu Technology Center, contributing to simulation-driven design optimization for downhole engineering tools.

His current interests include unmanned aircraft design, robot vision, machine learning, robotic manipulation, and advanced manufacturing technologies.
